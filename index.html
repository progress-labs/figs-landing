          In 2024, we were reminded why FIGS exists—to celebrate and uplift our
          Awesome Humans as you take on challenges most of us can’t even
          imagine. Your resilience and dedication inspires us to innovate,
          ensuring every shift is met with the quality, comfort, and performance
          you deserve. We have doubled down on advocacy, driving meaningful
          change in the policies that impact your lives.
        </p>
        <!-- Second paragraph of the letter -->
        <p class="content__text-description">
          This year, we amplified the voices of healthcare professionals on
          Capitol Hill, donated a record number of FIGS through Threads for
          Threads, and gave a spotlight to Team USA’s medical team at the 2024
          Olympic and Paralympic Games. Your stories drive us to push
          boundaries, design with purpose, advocate boldly, and create a future
          where you’re truly valued. Thank you for inspiring us to build the
          world we all want to live in.
